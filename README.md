# SymDLNN
Code base acompanying the paper Discrete Lagrangian Neural Networks with Automatic Symmetry Discovery

## Prerequisites

In order to run the code we require several packages, conda users can use the `environment.yml` to generate the necessary virtual environment from terminal

Use the terminal or an Anaconda Prompt (for windows users) for the following steps:

1. Create the environment from the environment.yml file:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```
The first line of the yml file sets the new environment's name. This process can take a while despite the number of dependencies being low, because of the dependency checker in conda. Go grab a coffee.

2. Activate the new environment once environment is created: 

```bash
conda activate symdlnn
```

3. This is your own environment, feel free to install any other dependencies
